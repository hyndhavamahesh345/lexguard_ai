🛡️ LexGuard AI
Agentic AI for Transaction-Level GST & TDS Compliance Validation
📌 Overview
LexGuard AI is an agent-based compliance validation system designed to help businesses and accountants identify GST and TDS compliance issues at the time of transaction, instead of discovering them later during audits.

Traditional accounting software focuses on recording transactions and filing returns, while compliance verification relies heavily on manual interpretation of tax laws by humans. LexGuard AI bridges this gap by introducing structured, explainable, AI-driven compliance checks for common GST and TDS scenarios.

❗ Problem Statement
Ensuring continuous compliance with complex and evolving regulatory and tax laws requires significant manual effort to cross-reference financial transactions against applicable legal clauses.

Current Challenges:
Compliance checks are manual and experience-driven
GST & TDS rules are complex and error-prone
Errors are typically identified during audits
MSMEs lack dedicated compliance teams
Existing accounting tools do not validate compliance
💡 Proposed Solution
LexGuard AI introduces an Agentic AI architecture that validates financial transactions against predefined GST and TDS rules and provides clear, explainable feedback.

Instead of replacing accountants or automating tax filing, LexGuard AI:

Acts as a compliance validation layer
Supports real-time decision-making
Reduces audit risk caused by human error
🧠 System Architecture (Agent-Based Design)
LexGuard AI is built using specialized AI agents, each with a single responsibility.

🔹 Agents Overview
1. Transaction Understanding Agent
Interprets raw transaction input
Classifies transaction type (rent, service, purchase, etc.)
Extracts structured information
2. Rule Retrieval Agent
Fetches relevant GST/TDS rules from a structured knowledge base
Filters rules based on transaction type and date
3. Compliance Evaluation Agent
Applies thresholds, rates, and aggregation logic
Determines compliance status (Compliant / Non-Compliant)
4. Explanation Agent
Converts compliance results into human-readable explanations
References applicable legal sections
Suggests corrective actions

📚 Knowledge Base Strategy
GST and TDS rules are stored in a structured, machine-readable format
Rules are curated for common compliance scenarios (MVP scope)
Designed to be maintainable and auditable
Supports future extension with AI-assisted rule change detection
Legal interpretation is not fully automated. Human validation remains essential.
